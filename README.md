# Usage

You need Python 2.7 (Python 3 **won't work**)
Run it from a Windows command-line. (with admin privileges ?)

``` python

idbe_decrypt.py TITLE_ID <optional: VERSION>

```
Not providing a VERSION will fetch the icon for the latest title version

Example:


``` cmd

idbe_decrypt.py 00050000-10113500

```

This will produce this output:
